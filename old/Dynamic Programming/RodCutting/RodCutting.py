###PROBLEM###
#We are given a rod of length n and we are given the array of prices, also of
#length n. This array contains the price for selling a rod at a certain length.
#For example, prices[5] shows the price we can sell a rod of length 5.
#Generalising, prices[x] shows the price a rod of length x can be sold.
#We are tasked to find the optimal solution to sell the given rod.


###SOLUTION###
#Profit(n) = max(1<i<n){Price(n),Price(i)+Profit(n-i)}

#When we receive a rod, we have two options:
#a) Don't cut it and sell it as is (receiving prices[length])
#b) Cut it and sell it in two parts. The length we cut it and the rod we are
#left with, which we have to try and sell separately in an efficient way.
#Choose the maximum price we can get.

def CutRod(n):
    if(n == 1):
        #Cannot cut rod any further
        return prices[1];

    noCut = prices[n]; #The price you get when you don't cut the rod
    yesCut = [-1 for x in range(n)]; #The prices for the different cutting options

    for i in range(1,n):
        if(solutions[i] == -1):
            #We haven't calulated solution for length i yet.
            #We know we sell the part of length i so we get prices[i].
            #We just need to know how to sell rod of length n-i
            yesCut[i] = prices[i] + CutRod(n-i);
        else:
            #We have calculated solution for length i.
            #We add the two prices.
            yesCut[i] = prices[i] + solutions[n-i];

    #We need to find the highest price in order to sell more efficiently.
    #We have to choose between noCut and the prices in yesCut.
    m = noCut; #Initialize max to noCut
    for i in range(n):
        if(yesCut[i] > m):
            m = yesCut[i];

    solutions[n] = m;
    return m;



length = 5;
#The first price, 0, is for when we have no rod.
prices = [0,1,3,7,9,11,13,17,21,21,30];
solutions = [-1 for x in range(length+1)];
